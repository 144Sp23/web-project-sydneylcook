                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h3>Hello, my name is Sydney Cook.</h3>
                <p>I am a student at Northwest Missouri State University working towards my bachelor of science degree in Digitial Media: Content Strategy.</p>
                <p>My career interest started off in photography. When I joined the yearbook staff in high school, I was able to take photos and design pages, which is ultimately where I found my passion.</p>
                <p>Since my first semester of college, I've been working for the on-campus newspaper, the Northwest Missourian, and have done a variety of positions while employed.
