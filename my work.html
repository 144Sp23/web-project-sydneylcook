            <p>Northwest offers practicum courses to provide on-hands experience for students. While taking Journalism Practicum, I worked as a designer for the newspaper and designed pages for print. Each week I would be assigned new pages. The ones shown above were printed during the Spring 2023 semester.</p>

            <p>Photography has been a big inspiration within my life and interests. I started by only taking landscape and nature shots of everything around me. Then, I worked up to taking pictures for friends and family members. Since then, I have taken on clients and provide a variety of services, including portraits and live events.</p>
